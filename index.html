		<h1>The Collectivised Repository of the Works of Alex, Terran, and Toby.</h1>

		<h2>FAQs</h2>
			<p>Q: Why does this website look like it is from 1993? Is this some stylistic choice?<br>A: No. The stylesheet won't link to this page for some reason. However, if anyone asks i can just say that I was tryig to match the age of the games (Sorry Alex and Terran, but some modern game studios have moved beyond tic-tac-toe).<br>Q: Do you plan on adding any links or contetn to this site? It appears rather useless.<br>A: Of course! Here is a link just for you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">link</a>
